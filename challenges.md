# botillo - Proposed Challenges

List with a brief description of the task/problem we want to solve.

## Check where has your HDD space gone

### Description

The time has come your computer is starting to act weird and you just realized that you are running out of disk space.

Ok, so we need to clean up a bit we are willing to do that, but wait is there a easy way to find out where to start looking where to focus our main efforts?

## ~Convert a csv file into a JSON file to be used in a web application~

### Description

A nice CSV file has arrived to our hands and we want to use it for our next web app, but it would be much easier for us to have it in a json format to handle it easily in Javascript.

Wouldn't it be nice to find a tool that does that conversion for us without too much hassle?

### Solution

[Solved here](csvjson/README.md)
