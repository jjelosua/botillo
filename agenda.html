<h3>
<a id="intro" class="anchor" href="#intro" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>We are hoping to make this session really dynamic, with everybody contributing, sharing knowledge and common problems that arise in our daily work.</p>

<p>We are going to divide ourselves into small groups to ease the internal brainstorming/discussion. The flow of the session will be based on a finite number of iterations, explained in more detail <a href="#iterations">here</a></p>

<p>There will be two ways to contribute during the session:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Adding challenges</strong>: Hoping that someone on your group or other groups will have some kind of guidance on how to solve them. <strong>Challenges will be our fuel</strong> that will keep the session going throughout its iterations, so don't be shy and share those, probably others have encountered the same problem and ideally they have found a solution or at least you can discuss how to approach it in the future.</li>
<li><strong>Adding solutions</strong>: Whenever a challenge is proposed in your group or reaches your group in following iterations, if someone has used a tool that tackles a problem efficiently or have written an script that could be adapted to that particular task, or have an idea to try to approach it. Those are our desired outcomes of our session yay!!!!. Please withdraw the challenge from the iteration flow and work on the solution.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are going analog baby!!, Post-it power!!</p>

<h3>
<a id="example" class="anchor" href="#example" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example</h3>
<p>To set up the pace and focus on the kind of tasks/challenges we are hoping to address today we will use the first five minutes to show an example task and show the solution we have come up with.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that we are aiming for small time savers, tasks that you think can be automated somehow but did not find the time to approach it. We are not aiming for complex problems that require complex solutions.</p>

<h3>
<a id="groups" class="anchor" href="#groups" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Group formation</h3>

<p>After the example problem has been presented, we are going to break into groups, depending on the overall amount of assistants.</p>

<p>We are hoping that spliting up into smaller groups will lead to a more effective brainstorm of challenges/solutions.</p>

<p>We are going to need a volunteer for each group that will act as the speaker of the group, come on...do not be shy!!!</p>

<h3>
<a id="iterations" class="anchor" href="#iterations" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Iterations</h3>

<p>We are going to divide the session in multiple iterations. Creating a chain of groups 1-2-3...etc.</p>

<p>The first iteration will be special (Aprox. 20 min). It will be longer and each group will have an icebreaker challenge on their table. This is not meant to be the focus of the discussion during the first iteration, but just to serve as a fire starter. Discuss how you would approach the task and think about all the other tasks that can use some automation/optimization that come to your mind. Write those down in a colored post-it adding the number of your group at the top-left corner.</p>

<p>Since this new challenges that you are introducing in the iterations flow will be read be other groups later on, try to be thorough with the challenge explanation and write it in the most readable way possible.</p>

<p>Please remember that challenges are the fuel for our iteration process so bring those in, if you are in doubt, write it down, if you think it may be too simple, write it down, don't hesitate just write it down and add it to the flow of the session.</p>

<p><strong>Iteration workflow</strong></p>

<p>In subsequent iterations (Aprox 10 mins) you will give your unsolved challenges to the next group in the chain while the previous group in the chain will give your group their unsolved challenges.</p>

<p>Once your group has the new challenges the speaker will read them to the rest of the team and as with the initial iteration if somebody finds/has a solution act as described in the solutions segment.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong></p>

<p>If during the first discussion or in later iterations, some team member comes up with a plausible solution to a challenge. Then that teammate will withdraw the challenge post-it from the iterations flow and will write the given solution in another colored post-it sticking it on top of the original challenge.</p>

<p>Give the solution and challenge to any of the co-facilitators so that we can incorporate them into the etherpad.</p>

<p>At the end of the session, we are going to leave some amount of time to go over some of the solutions we have found and the problems that have arisen. If someone feels inspired by the challenges that have been proposed and thinks that there is a tool that will help with some of them and that everybody should know about, please approach us during the session so that we can be sure to leave some space for it to let you talk to the participants at the end of the session.</p>

<h3>
<a id="conclusions" class="anchor" href="#conclusions" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusions and wrapup</h3>

<p>After the last iteration, we will go through the solved challenges (Aprox. 10 mins). If any of the participants has expressed the intention to explain to the overall group a tool/productivity tips then we will have time for that. If there are no volunteers we will pick some of the solutions that the group has thought of and discuss it in deeper detail.</p>

<p><strong>Post-session work</strong></p>

<p>As session facilitators we will write down all the challenges that have been proposed on the etherpad and we will ask for your collaboration one last time, if you think that the challenge or the proposed solution needs further explanation please complete it on the etherpad once it is available.</p>

<p>After SRCCON has ended, sniff. We will dump the etherpad contents into the <a href="https://github.com/jjelosua/botillo" target="_blank">botillo</a> repo so that it serves for future reference and allows interested contributors to continue working on the challenges afterwards through pull requests.</p>

<p>We hope that you have enjoyed the session and that it has helped you think about daily challenges and better ways to approach them to be more productive.</p>
